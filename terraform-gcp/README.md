## About

This is my [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) workflow for every terraform project that I use personally/professionaly when working with Google Cloud Platform.

## Installation

I usually add this project as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to the terraform [root module](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/modules#the-root-module) directory, and then create a symlink to the makefile, for example:

```bash
# add submodule 
git submodule add https://github.com/serpro69/terraform-makefile.git
# create a symlink
ln -s terraform-makefile/Makefile Makefile
# test it out
make help
```

Using a git submodule makes it easier to pull latest changes and fixes, if you're interested in those.

You can, of course, just download the [raw version of Makefile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/serpro69/terraform-makefile/master/Makefile) and add it directly to your project.

## Usage

View a description of Makefile targets with `help` via the [self-documenting makefile](https://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html).

➜ make
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This Makefile contains opinionated targets that wrap terraform commands,
providing sane defaults, initialization shortcuts for terraform environment,
and support for remote terraform backends via Google Cloud Storage.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Usage:
> GCP_PROJECT=demo WORKSPACE=demo make init
> make plan

Tip: Add a <space> before the command if it contains sensitive information,
to keep it from bash history!

> [!NOTE]
> Before each target, several private Makefile functions run to configure the remote state backend: `_set-env`, `_check-ws`, ...
> You should never have to run these yourself.

### State Lock

The GCS backend implements it's own locking mechanism by creating a `.lock` file in the same bucket for each workspace.
See more in the [State Locking](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/state/locking) docs.

### Considerations

- Each time this makefile is used, the remote state will be pulled from the GCS backend. This can result in slightly longer iteration times.
- The makefile uses `.ONESHELL`, which may not be available in all make implementations.

## Ack

This makefile was inspired by:

- [pgporada/terraform-makefile](https://github.com/pgporada/terraform-makefile)

## TODO

- [ ] `init`
  - ask user if they want to re-initialize the config, and only proceed with `init` on positive answer
  - with this, we can safely call `init` target from other targets, i.e. `plan` or `apply` (currently this would produce too much noise from init on each plan/apply/... command)
